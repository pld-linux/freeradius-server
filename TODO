# TODO:
- check log files permisions - should be writable by radius user/group
  (log files are created by server)
- prepare to use with --as-needed
- ac/am regeneration doesn't work
- move plugins into separate packages:
  /usr/sbin/radsniff: libpcap
  /usr/lib/freeradius/rlm_eap_ikev2-2.1.1.so: libeap-ikev2
- After install/uninstall every module perform daemon restart
- what about links in /usr/lib/freeradius/ - required? *.la?
